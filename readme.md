---

This project contains the code examples and exercises related to the workshop I had conducted at the MVJ College Of Engineering, Bengaluru.

The slides related to the workshop can be found **[here](http://www.slideshare.net/ArpitPoladia/java-handson-workshop)**.

Credits go to the book **[Thinking in Java by Bruce Eckel](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Books/TIJ4/)**. I strongly recommend all Java programmers to buy and read this book cover to cover.
